## Usage

### Accessing Purchase History
1. Navigate to `/purchase-history` or click "Purchase History" in the account sidebar
2. View order statistics at the top
3. Browse through past orders
4. Click "View" to expand order details

### Managing Settings

2. Edit profile information
3. Configure notification preferences
4. Adjust privacy settings
5. Set user preferences
6. Click "Save All Settings" to persist changes

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- React components with Tailwind CSS styling
- Custom hooks for state management
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

### Backend
- Express.js API endpoints
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- JWT authentication
- Firebase Admin integration

### Data Flow
1. User settings are stored in both localStorage and database
2. Settings sync automatically when user logs in
3. Changes are saved immediately to localStorage and queued for API sync
4. Purchase history is fetched from the database on page load

## Future Enhancements

1. **Export Purchase History**: Allow users to download their purchase history as PDF/CSV
2. **Order Tracking**: Add shipment tracking for physical products
3. **Advanced Settings**: More granular notification and privacy controls

6. **Push Notifications**: Implement browser push notifications
7. **Order Reviews**: Allow users to review purchased items
8. **Subscription Management**: Handle recurring payments and subscriptions

## Security Considerations

- All endpoints require authentication
- User can only access their own data
- Settings are validated on both client and server
- Sensitive information is properly sanitized
- Account deletion requires confirmation

## Testing

   - Create some test orders in the database
   - Navigate to `/purchase-history`
   - Verify order display and statistics

2. **Settings**:
   - Navigate to `/account/settings`
   - Modify various settings
   - Verify persistence across page reloads
   - Test account deletion flow

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - Test all endpoints with valid authentication
   - Verify error handling for invalid requests
   - Check data validation and sanitization
